1. Importance and intrinsic value of the project

The main reason for the lack of sporting success in our country for a long time is that qualified athletes from the infrastructure are not recognised and valued by professional clubs or organisations. In our country, the limited possibilities of "scouts", i.e. people who monitor and report on athletic talent, are only sufficient to monitor certain athletes. There is a need for a system that facilitates the monitoring of infrastructures, as well as regional and junior leagues, which are just as important as infrastructures, or to get an idea. The practice of sports scholarships, which has been implemented in our country since the past and has given hope to many students, is in a similar situation to the problem of infrastructures. From secondary school to high school, from high school to university, students seeking a sports scholarship are in a similar situation to the talented athletes waiting to be monitored in the infrastructures. These two important points show the extent of the problem and the importance of the issue.

2. Aim and purpose of the project

The aim of the project is to monitor and evaluate the athletes in the infrastructures who are candidates for professionalism and to identify and benefit from the athletes who are candidates for the athlete scholarship granted by the State for secondary, high school and university. The aim is to facilitate the identification of these young athletes for the benefit of young athletes, which is the main objective of the project.
